    Hi, I'm Michelle! I'm a graduate of Nashville Software School who recently landed their first job in web
    development.

    While I was in bootcamp, we focused on learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Reactm Python and Django. In my new position,
    we are using Python along with Flask/Jinja2 and HTMX.
  </p>

    To learn those new-to-me technolgies, I am currently enrolled in <a
      href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-developer-bootcamp-flask-python/">this</a> Udemy course, where one of three
    projects is building this portfolio website.
